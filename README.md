## ABSTRACT
Our main idea was to create a bot which can pick garbage directly from dustbin.


## MOTIVATION
In this present era, people live a very busy life. In such a situation, a person will always look for the way to save
time.So introducing the robot, WALL-E that can collect waste directly from dustbins and  then dispose the waste to the area which is already predefined. 



## MECHANICAL ASPECT OF THE DESIGN


Our bot has differential chasis with  three wheels out of which one is castor wheel and the other two motors are connected with two motors which provide movement to the bot.
With the help of these wheels, the bot can move in all directions.The hands were operated using three dc motors.The "up-down" motion of hands were provided  using worm and spur gear mechanism.The hands were able to converge or diverge with the help of pulley and belt mechanism.
The body was made using channels and plywood whereas the head was 3D printed.


## ELECTRONICS ASPECT OF THE DESIGN
We used two microcontrollers namely Arduino Uno and Arduino Nano for the this bot.Uno was used for movements of wheels and hands whereas nano was used for operating the head including LED Matrix used as the eyes of our bot, WallE.
The arduino code can be found in "src" folder. Our bot was controlled through an Android device using an app made on MITAppInventor2. A bluetooth module was used for transmission of commands from android device to our bot. All the dc motors were powered through Li-Po dc battery.


## COST STRUCTURE
Cost of making this bot is around Rs.8000.


## APPLICATIONS
Wall-E can collect garbage directly from dustbins which can be disposed off later. It can be extremely useful for collecting toxic or harmful wastes and 
thus can be used in hospitals, industries etc. 


## LIMITATIONS
Currently, our bot is manually operated and thus require human help to be operated.


## FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
Many furthur improvements can be done in this robot. Using IOT, this bot can be controlled from anywhere and can be live-streamed using webcam.
It can be made autonomous using ML so that it can detect dustbins and collect garbage.Hence, it will no longer require commands to move, pick or dump.
